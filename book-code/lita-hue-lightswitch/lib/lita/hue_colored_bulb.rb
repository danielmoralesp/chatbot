  # Hue's color coordinate system has about 64,000 distinct hues. For Lita
  #   purposes you're fine starting with these twelve familiar options.
  #
  # The colors are listed in ascending order of hue along the color wheel
  #   starting at red, moving clockwise up through green and blue,
  #   and looping back around to the starting point to end at the same
  #   red where they began.	

  # Each color's corresponding hue number is one-twelfth of the circle's 
  #   circumference higher than the previous color. If red is 0 then orange is
  #   65535 / 12 * 1, or 5461. Yellow is twice that at 10,922. Rose is 60,073.
